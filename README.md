# Editor AI

Throughout the spring 2024 semester, our team has been building EditorAI. We hope work continues on this project in the future so that hyperlocal journalists are best equipt with tools to create high quality content.

## Description: 
A project aimed at aiding hyper-local news sites. This tool is meant to assist busy editors who are often working solo or with a limited staff producing news. Control should always rest with the editorial staff. The bot should make helpful suggestions that the staff can either accept or reject and to should fit comfortably into their workflow.

## This chatbot is designed to: 
Detect and correct grammar and spelling
Edit stories to comply with the AP style
Suggest and generate headlines
Propose new content ideas and sources that could improve an article. 
Suggest and generate copy for social media posts.
